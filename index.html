                      <p class="right">I graduated from California Polytechnic University at Pomona received B.S. in Business Administration. During my senior year, I involved few web design projects with my classmates outside of my school curriculem. Moreover, I got hooked up with PHP programing landguage after I watched Facebook Founder Mark Zuckerberg's speech about how he started Facebook. I self taught PHP and started freelance job. After I graduated from college, I also got a job in federal government worked in Social Security Administratio. After two years of work there, I slowly reliazed that this is the not the job for me and I want to work in web develop sector as full time where my passion is.</p>

                      <p class="right">My favorite hobby is traveling. I enjoy travling oversea whatever I get a chance. I have been to so many different places such as Germany, France, Holland, Japan, Korea and Mexico. etc..
                      I enjoy travling because I like to explore different kinds of food. Moreover, it can give me an unlimited imagination allowed me to write a book in the future.
